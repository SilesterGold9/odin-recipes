    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Egg in the hole makes a delicious breakfast! A runny yolk egg cooked in
      the center of a piece of toast and eaten with a fork is a great way to
      enjoy an egg in a slightly different way. My kids feel fancy when eating
      these.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>1 Â½ teaspoons bacon grease</li>
      <li>1 slice bread</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Melt bacon grease in a nonstick pan over low heat.</li>
      <li>
        Cut a 2-inch hole in the center of bread slice; place in the hot skillet
        and cook until lightly toasted, about 2 minutes. Flip bread and crack
        egg into the hole; season with salt and pepper. Continue to cook until
        egg is cooked and mostly firm; flip again and cook 1 minute more. Serve
        immediately.
